# Discord-ChatBot
A Discord ChatBot made with Discord.py and pandorabots its very configurable and easy to self host. this bot was based of jagroshs frost bot which is now very outdated due to the discord.py rewrite ive also greatly improved most of the bot.

The bot was made with Discord.py 1.3.3 and you'll also need aiohttp to get it running those are the bots only two dependencies. 


Setup:

1) get a bot token from https://discord.com/developers/applications and then place it in the config file.

2) then you wanna get a botID from pandoraBots https://pandorabots.com/botmaster/en/mostactive pick a bot from here click on it and on the url section you should see a part thats like botid=b0dafd24ee35a477 you wanna copy the part after the equal sign and put it in the config file by default chomsky is the bot id but you can change it to whatever.

3) then fill out the rest of the parts in the config file they're fairly self explanatory.
